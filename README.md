# Pig Game Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project implements a simple dice game using vanilla JavaScript, where two players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate scores. The game starts with both players having a score of zero, and the dice roll determines how much score the active player can add to their current score. The game allows players to roll the dice or hold their score. Rolling a 1 causes the current player's score to reset and switches the turn to the other player. If a player reaches or exceeds a score of 100, they win the game, and their victory is highlighted. The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the "New Game" button, which resets all scores and game states. The user interface dynamically updates to reflect the current scores, dice roll, and player turns.
